## üîí **Security Features**

### **Ownership Validation:**
- Club admins can **only** access clubs they're assigned to
- System validates `req.user.assignedClub === clubId` 
- Prevents cross-club access

### **Role Validation:**
- Each endpoint checks specific role requirements
- Super admin has highest privileges
- Club admin limited to their assigned club
- Regular admin cannot interfere with clubs

### **Username Format Enforcement:**
- Club admin usernames must follow `dbuxxxxxxxx` pattern
- Automatic password generation (`Admin123#`)
- Email uniqueness validation

## ‚úÖ **Implementation Status**

**‚úÖ COMPLETED:**
- Super admin role and permissions
- Club admin ownership validation  
- Role-based middleware (superAdminOnly, clubAdminOnly, clubAdminOwnership)
- Updated all club management routes
- Restricted club creation to super admin only
- Restricted club admin creation to super admin only
- Club admin can only manage assigned club

**üéØ RESULT:**
- **Super Admin (dbu10101010)**: Creates clubs and assigns admins
- **Club Admin (dbuxxxxxxxx)**: Manages ONLY their assigned club (no joining clubs)
- **No cross-access**: Club admins cannot interfere with other clubs or join as members
- **Role Separation**: Club admins manage clubs, students join clubs
- **Secure**: Each role has exactly the permissions they need

The system now enforces **strict role separation** - club admins are managers, not members. They cannot join clubs but can manage their assigned club exclusively!
