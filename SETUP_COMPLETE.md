# âœ… Admin Users Setup Complete

## Summary

Two admin users have been successfully configured with direct dashboard access privileges:

### 1. Club Administrator
- **Username:** `dbu10101015`
- **Password:** `Admin1234#`
- **Login:** `POST /api/club-admin/login`
- **Dashboard:** `GET /api/club-management/dashboard`

### 2. Academic Affairs Officer
- **Username:** `dbu10101016`
- **Password:** `Admin12345#`
- **Login:** `POST /api/academic-affairs/login`
- **Dashboard:** `GET /api/academic-affairs/dashboard`

## What Was Done

1. **Updated User Creation Utility** (`backend/utils/createAdmin.js`)
   - Added Club Admin user with username `dbu10101015`
   - Added Academic Affairs user with username `dbu10101016`
   - Configured proper roles and permissions
   - Set up automatic creation on server startup

2. **Verified Login Endpoints**
   - Club Admin login: `/api/club-admin/login` âœ“
   - Academic Affairs login: `/api/academic-affairs/login` âœ“
   - Both endpoints properly configured in server routes

3. **Role-Based Permissions**
   - Club Admin: Can manage assigned clubs, approve members
   - Academic Affairs: Can resolve academic complaints, upload documents

## How It Works

When the backend server starts:
1. MongoDB connection is established
2. `createDefaultAdmin()` utility runs automatically
3. Checks if users exist:
   - If not: Creates new users with specified credentials
   - If yes: Updates existing users with new credentials and roles
4. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
5. Users are ready to login immediately

## Next Steps

### To Use the System:

1. **Start MongoDB:**
   ```bash
   mongod
   ```

2. **Start Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Users are automatically created/updated on server startup**

4. **Login as Club Admin:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/club-admin/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username": "dbu10101015", "password": "Admin1234#"}'
   ```

5. **Login as Academic Affairs:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/academic-affairs/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username": "dbu10101016", "password": "Admin12345#"}'
   ```

## Files Modified

- âœ… `backend/utils/createAdmin.js` - Added new admin users
- âœ… `ADMIN_CREDENTIALS.md` - Created detailed documentation
- âœ… `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This summary file

## Security

- âœ… Passwords are securely hashed
- âœ… JWT tokens for authentication
- âœ… Role-based access control
- âœ… Account lockout after failed attempts
- âœ… Protected routes require valid tokens

## Testing

Both users can immediately login and access their respective dashboards as soon as the backend server starts with MongoDB running.
