## Security Considerations

1. **Role-Based Access Control:**
   - All endpoints validate user role before allowing actions
   - Club Admins can only access their assigned club
   - Academic Affairs limited to academic complaints

2. **Data Validation:**
   - All inputs validated on backend
   - File uploads restricted by type and size
   - User authentication required for sensitive operations

3. **Permission Checks:**
   - Frontend hides UI elements based on role
   - Backend enforces permissions on every request
   - No trust in frontend validation alone

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Academic Affairs user not found
**Solution:** Run `node backend/setup_admin_users.js` to create the user

### Issue: Cannot update clubs as President Admin
**Solution:** Verify user has role='president_admin' and proper authentication token

### Issue: Club Admin cannot see manage button
**Solution:** Ensure Club Admin has `assignedClub` field set to the club's ObjectId

### Issue: Academic Affairs can see non-academic complaints
**Solution:** Check complaint `complaintType` field is set correctly

## Future Enhancements

1. **Club Admin Dashboard:**
   - Dedicated dashboard for club admins
   - Analytics for club activities
   - Event management interface

2. **Academic Affairs Dashboard:**
   - Enhanced academic content posting
   - Document library management
   - Academic calendar integration

3. **Enhanced Permissions:**
   - Granular permission system
   - Custom role creation
   - Permission inheritance
